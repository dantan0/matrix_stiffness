# Structural Analysis

This MATLAB program was written to find the deformed shape and bending moment diagrams of a statically indeterminate beam. The method of computation is the direct stiffness method which is commonly implemented by commercial finite element software for strutural analysis. 

Wikipedia provides an intro explanation of this methodology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method
