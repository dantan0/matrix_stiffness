# Structural-Analysis

This MATLAB program was written by me and Dr. Gracie at the UWaterloo in order to find the deformed shape and bending moment diagrams of an indeterminate beam. The goal is to demistify how a strucutral analysis software like SAP works. 

A brief description of the purpose has been included in the heading of each file.
