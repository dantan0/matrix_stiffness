# Structural-Analysis

This MATLAB program was written to find the deformed shape and bending moment diagrams of a statically indeterminate beam. The method of computation is the direct stiffness method which is commonly implemeneted by commercial finite element software for strutural analysis. 

The wikipedia page provides an easy intro for this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method
