# Structural Analysis

This MATLAB program demonstrates the use of the direct stiffness method for structural analysis by finding the deformed shape and bending moment diagrams of a statically indeterminate beam. This just means that there are not enough static equilibrium equations for solving the internal forces and reactions of a structure. 
The direct stiffness method is by far the most common method for commercial finite element software and originated from the field of aerospace engineering. 

Here is an explanation of this methodology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method.
